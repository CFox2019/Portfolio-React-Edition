      <p>
        I’m an experienced leader turned software developer returning
        to the workforce after pausing my career to stay at home with
        my family. I’ve spent the last few years volunteering at my
        children’s school as a room-parent and working with the PTA.
        I’m excited to re-enter the workforce and utilize my organizational,
        collaboration, and new found software development skills to help
        deliver products/features that drive business and consumer value.
        I’d love to chat about any opportunities you may have.
      </p>
