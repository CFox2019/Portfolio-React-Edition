## Description
In my portfolio, you can find the 'About Me' page is the first page you will see. This includes my portrait and a description about myself. This page also includes links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and my Resume. To view a portfolio of my work/projects, click 'Portfolio' in the nav bar. From there, you can view an image of my projects, along with their deployed links and their direct GitHub repositories.
